# Employee Polls Project

This project is my submission for Udacity's React Nanodegree program final project. It is a simple polling app that allows the user to log in with credentials of any user stored in `src/_DATA.js`. The user can view polls on the homepage, separated by answered and unanswered polls. You can view a leaderboard that shows which users have answered the most questions. You can also submit your own poll.

This app manages its state using Redux and its testing suite is Jest.

## Instructions for use:

1. Installing dependencies: to run the project, you must first have `npm` installed on your machine and run `npm install` in a terminal at the root folder of your project. This will install all project dependencies in a `node_modules` folder at the root of your project.

2. Running the project: run `npm run start` in a terminal at the root folder of the project

- Logging in: for ease of use, the following credentials are set by default:

  - Username: mtsamis
  - Password: xyz123

  > Note: you can use the credentials of any `user` in the store.

3. Testing the project: run `npm run test` in a terminal at the root folder of the project.

## Original Starter README

This is the starter code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

- Users
- Questions
